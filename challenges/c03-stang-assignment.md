*Purpose*: When designing structures such as bridges, boats, and planes,
the design team needs data about *material properties*. Often when we
engineers first learn about material properties through coursework, we
talk about abstract ideas and look up values in tables without ever
looking at the data that gave rise to published properties. In this
challenge you’ll study an aluminum alloy dataset: Studying these data
will give you a better sense of the challenges underlying published
material values.

In this challenge, you will load a real dataset, wrangle it into tidy
form, and perform EDA to learn more about the data.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

*Background*: In 1946, scientists at the Bureau of Standards tested a
number of Aluminum plates to determine their
[elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus) and
[Poisson’s ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio).
These are key quantities used in the design of structural members, such
as aircraft skin under [buckling
loads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling). These scientists tested
plats of various thicknesses, and at different angles with respect to
the [rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_(metalworking))
direction.

# Loading and Wrangle

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

The `readr` package in the Tidyverse contains functions to load data
form many sources. The `read_csv()` function will help us load the data
for this challenge.

``` r
## NOTE: If you extracted all challenges to the same location,
## you shouldn't have to change this filename
filename <- "./data/stang.csv"

## Load the data
df_stang <- read_csv(filename)
```

    ## Rows: 9 Columns: 8
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): alloy
    ## dbl (7): thick, E_00, nu_00, E_45, nu_45, E_90, nu_90
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
df_stang
```

    ## # A tibble: 9 × 8
    ##   thick  E_00 nu_00  E_45  nu_45  E_90 nu_90 alloy  
    ##   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>

    ## 2 0.022 10600 0.323 10500  0.331 10700 0.323 al_24st
    ## 3 0.032 10400 0.329 10400  0.318 10300 0.322 al_24st
    ## 4 0.032 10300 0.319 10500  0.326 10400 0.33  al_24st
    ## 5 0.064 10500 0.323 10400  0.331 10400 0.327 al_24st
    ## 6 0.064 10700 0.328 10500  0.328 10500 0.32  al_24st

    ## 9 0.081 10000 0.311    -1 -1      9900 0.314 al_24st

Note that these data are not tidy! The data in this form are convenient
for reporting in a table, but are not ideal for analysis.

### **q1** Tidy `df_stang` to produce `df_stang_long`. You should have column names `thick, alloy, angle, E, nu`. Make sure the `angle` variable is of correct type. Filter out any invalid values.

*Hint*: You can reshape in one `pivot` using the `".value"` special
value for `names_to`.

``` r
## TASK: Tidy `df_stang`
df_stang_long <-
  df_stang %>%
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = c(".value", "angle"),
    names_sep = "_",
    cols = c(-thick, -alloy)
  ) %>%
  mutate(angle = as.integer(angle)) %>%
  filter(if_all(everything(), ~ . >= 0))

df_stang_long
```

    ## # A tibble: 26 × 5
    ##    thick alloy   angle     E    nu
    ##    <dbl> <chr>   <int> <dbl> <dbl>
    ##  1 0.022 al_24st     0 10600 0.321
    ##  2 0.022 al_24st    45 10700 0.329
    ##  3 0.022 al_24st    90 10500 0.31 
    ##  4 0.022 al_24st     0 10600 0.323
    ##  5 0.022 al_24st    45 10500 0.331
    ##  6 0.022 al_24st    90 10700 0.323
    ##  7 0.032 al_24st     0 10400 0.329
    ##  8 0.032 al_24st    45 10400 0.318
    ##  9 0.032 al_24st    90 10300 0.322
    ## 10 0.032 al_24st     0 10300 0.319
    ## # ℹ 16 more rows

Use the following tests to check your work.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change this
## Names
assertthat::assert_that(
  setequal(
    df_stang_long %>% names(),
    c("thick", "alloy", "angle", "E", "nu")
  )
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
## Dimensions
assertthat::assert_that(all(dim(df_stang_long) == c(26, 5)))
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
## Type
assertthat::assert_that(
  (df_stang_long %>% pull(angle) %>% typeof()) == "integer"
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
print("Very good!")
```

    ## [1] "Very good!"

# EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

## Initial checks

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q2** Perform a basic EDA on the aluminum data *without visualization*. Use your analysis to answer the questions under *observations* below. In addition, add your own *specific* question that you’d like to answer about the data—you’ll answer it below in q3.

``` r
## I wasnt really sure what to do here because I was able to answer my questions by looking through the dataframe output from q1.



df_stang_long %>%
  lapply(unique)
```

    ## $thick
    ## [1] 0.022 0.032 0.064 0.081
    ## 
    ## $alloy
    ## [1] "al_24st"
    ## 
    ## $angle
    ## [1]  0 45 90
    ## 
    ## $E
    ## [1] 10600 10700 10500 10400 10300 10000  9900 10100
    ## 
    ## $nu
    ##  [1] 0.321 0.329 0.310 0.323 0.331 0.318 0.322 0.319 0.326 0.330 0.327 0.328
    ## [13] 0.320 0.315 0.314 0.312 0.316 0.311

**Observations**:

- Is there “one true value” for the material properties of Aluminum?
  - No because these values change based on the type of alloy used and
    the thickness of the sample.
- How many aluminum alloys are in this dataset? How do you know?
  - 1 alloy is in this dataset because the only value in the alloy
    column was “al_24st”
- What angles were tested?
  - The angles measured (probably by a strain triple gauge arrangement
    offset by 45 degrees from each other) were 0, 45, 90 degrees.
- What thicknesses were tested?
  - 0.022 , 0.034, 0.064, 0.081 meters\* \*probably meters I really
    couldn’t find what units were used.
- How does the thickness relate to young’s modulus (E)?
  - Across all 3 values for each thickness when the thickness was
    increased compared to the previous thickness the youngs modulus
    decreased compared to the previous thickness. This means that the
    thicker the material is the lower its youngs modulus will be across
    all angles.

## Visualize

<!-- ------------------------- -->

### **q3** Create a visualization to investigate your question from q2 above. Can you find an answer to your question using the dataset? Would you need additional information to answer your question?

``` r
## TASK: Investigate your question from q1 here
library(ggplot2)
df_stang_long %>% ggplot(aes(x = thick, y = E, color = angle)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~angle) +
  ggtitle("Scatter Plot of thickness vs young's modulus across all measured angles") +
  ylab("Youngs Modlulus (E)") +
  xlab("Thickness (Meters)")
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- So i was partially right. I must have not checked the data so
  carefully when parsing the lists on my own because it seems that the
  0.6 value is higher then expected across the board. But ignoring that
  outlier the general trend across all 3 angles is that a higher
  thickness corresponds to a lower young’s modulus.

### **q4** Consider the following statement:

> “A material’s property (or material property) is an intensive property
> of some material, i.e. a physical property that does not depend on the
> amount of the material.”\[2\]

Note that the “amount of material” would vary with the thickness of a
tested plate. Does the following graph support or contradict the claim
that “elasticity `E` is an intensive material property.” Why or why not?
Is this evidence *conclusive* one way or another? Why or why not?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change; run this chunk
df_stang_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(nu, E, color = as_factor(thick))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-vis-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Does this graph support or contradict the claim above?
  - It (somewhat) contradicts the claim above because even though the
    data is super scattered and full of outliers and anomalous values
    the data (somewhat) suggests that Elasticity decreases the thinner
    the material gets which means its a property of the material that
    changes depending on the amount of material and this means it cannot
    be a intensive material property
- Is this evidence *conclusive* one way or another?
  - I do not think this is conclusive enough evidence to say for sure
    that the statement is false however because the data is very
    scattered and the pattern formed is not very defined. More research
    is required. Perhaps testing different metals or grades of aluminum
    to see if a pattern emerges or something changes.
